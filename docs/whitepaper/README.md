    Tools purpose-built for working with 16mm, Super8 and Regular8 film have not been produced commercially since the 
    The mcopy project proposes a modular, open-source platform for building optical tools for small gauge analog moviefilm formats.
    The platform can be used to assemble optical printers, digital transfer units and film recorders for digital images.

# Retrofitting Existing Hardware

# New Hardware

Retrofitting existing hardware was always intended as the first step to producing new hardware modules that could eventually completely replace all legacy machine parts.
This approach is sometimes referred to as a "Ship of Theseus pattern"[@wiki-shipoftheseus] and in this application is, simply put: build machines using parts that people and organizations already have until total replacements can be designed.
The practice of retrofitting hardware, in this case, required the kind of inspection that makes designing replacements possible: detailed measurements, documenting electrical diagrams, and review of sourced components.

Two examples of this pattern that have materialized new modular components are the projector and gate designs.
